“There was once a little Kid whose growing horns made him think he was a grown-up Billy Goat and able to take care of himself. So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the flock was gone. He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf. Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf! The Kid knew there was little hope for him. \“Please, Mr. Wolf,\” he said trembling, \“I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can.\“ The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily. Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade.”@“Do not let anything turn you from your purpose.”@“THE WOLF AND THE KID”

“The Tortoise, you know, carries his house on his back. No matter how hard he tries, he cannot leave home. They say that Jupiter punished him so, because he was such a lazy stay-at-home that he would not go to Jupiter's wedding, even when especially invited. After many years, Tortoise began to wish he had gone to that wedding. When he saw how gaily the birds flew about and how the Hare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by, always eager to see everything there was to be seen, the Tortoise felt very sad and discontented. He wanted to see the world too, and there he was with a house on his back and little short legs that could hardly drag him along. One day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble. \“We can help you to see the world,\” said the Ducks. \“Take hold of this stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or you will be sorry.\“ The Tortoise was very glad indeed. He seized the stick firmly with his teeth, the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end, and away they sailed up toward the clouds. Just then a Crow flew by. He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried: \“This must surely be the King of Tortoises!\“ \“Why certainly——\“ began the Tortoise. But as he opened his mouth to say these foolish words he lost his hold on the stick, and down he fell to the ground, where he was dashed to pieces on a rock.”@“Foolish curiosity and vanity often lead to misfortune.”@“THE TORTOISE AND THE DUCKS”

“\”Why in the world do you walk sideways like that?\” said a Mother Crab to her son. \“You should always walk straight forward with your toes turned out.\“ \“Show me how to walk, mother dear,\“ answered the little Crab obediently, \“I want to learn.\“ So the old Crab tried and _tried_ to walk straight forward. But she could walk sideways only, like her son. And when she wanted to turn her toes out she tripped and fell on her nose.”@“Do not tell others how to act unless you can set a good example.”@“THE YOUNG CRAB AND HIS MOTHER”
“An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily into the water, he crushed a young Frog into the mud. The old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of him. \”A _great big_ monster,\” said one of them, \”stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet!\” \”Big, was he!" said the old Frog, puffing herself up. "Was he as big as this?\” \”Oh, _much_ bigger!\” they cried. The Frog puffed up still more.\”He could not have been bigger than this," she said. But the little Frogs all declared that the monster was _much, much_ bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more until, all at once, she burst.”@“Do not attempt the impossible.””@“THE FROGS AND THE OX”

“A Dog and a Cock, who were the best of friends, wished very much to see something of the world. So they decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods. The two comrades traveled along in the very best of spirits and without meeting any adventure to speak of. At nightfall the Cock, looking for a place to roost, as was his custom, spied nearby a hollow tree that he thought would do very nicely for a night's lodging. The Dog could creep inside and the Cock would fly up on one of the branches. So said, so done, and both slept very comfortably. With the first glimmer of dawn the Cock awoke. For the moment he forgot just where he was. He thought he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to arouse the household at daybreak. So standing on tip-toes he flapped his wings and crowed lustily. But instead of awakening the farmer, he awakened a Fox not far
off in the wood. The Fox immediately had rosy visions of a very delicious breakfast. Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was roosting, he said very politely: \”A hearty welcome to our woods, honored sir. I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here. I am quite sure we shall become the closest of friends.\” \"I feel highly flattered, kind sir,\" replied the Cock slyly. \" If you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of the tree, my porter will let you in.\” The hungry but unsuspecting Fox, went around the tree as he was told, and in a twinkling the Dog had seized him.”@“Those who try to deceive may expect to be paid in their own coin.”@“THE DOG, THE COCK, AND THE FOX”

“The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day. Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a very young Mouse got up and said: \”I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful. All we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming.\" All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said: \"I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?\””@“It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it.”@“BELLING THE CAT”

“An Eagle, swooping down on powerful wings, seized a lamb in her talons and made off with it to her nest. A Jackdaw saw the deed, and his silly head was filled with the idea that he was big and strong enough to do as the Eagle had done. So with much rustling of feathers and a fierce air, he came down swiftly on the back of a large Ram. But when he tried to rise again he found that he could not get away, for his claws were tangled in the wool. And
so far was he from carrying away the Ram, that the Ram hardly noticed he was there. The Shepherd saw the fluttering Jackdaw and at once guessed what
had happened. Running up, he caught the bird and clipped its wings. That evening he gave the Jackdaw to his children. \”What a funny bird this is!\” they said laughing, \”what do you call it, father?\” \”That is a Jackdaw, my children. But if you should ask him, he would say he is an Eagle.\””@“Do not let your vanity make you overestimate your powers.”@“THE EAGLE AND THE JACKDAW”

“A Boy was given permission to put his hand into a pitcher to get some filberts. But he took such a great fistful that he could not draw his hand out again. There he stood, unwilling to give up a single filbert and yet unable to get them all out at once. Vexed and disappointed he began to cry. \”My boy," said his mother, "be satisfied with half the nuts you have taken and you will easily get your hand out. Then perhaps you may have some more filberts some other time.\””@“Do not attempt too much at once.”@“THE BOY AND THE FILBERTS”

“A Farmer was driving his wagon along a miry country road after a heavy rain. The horses could hardly drag the load through the deep mud, and at last came to a standstill when one of the wheels sank to the hub in a rut. The farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagon looking at it but without making the least effort to get it out of the rut. All he did was to curse his bad luck and call loudly on Hercules to come to his aid. Then, it is said, Hercules really did appear, saying: \”Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and urge on your horses. Do you think you can move the wagon by simply looking at it and whining about it? Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help yourself.\” And when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses, the wagon moved very readily, and soon the Farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned.”@“Self help is the best help. Heaven helps those who help themselves.”@“HERCULES AND THE WAGONER”

“A frisky young Kid had been left by the herdsman on the thatched roof of a sheep shelter to keep him out of harm's way. The Kid was browsing near the edge of the roof, when he spied a Wolf and began to jeer at him, making faces and abusing him to his heart's content. \”I hear you,\” said the Wolf, \”and I haven't the least grudge against you for what you say or do. When you are up there it is the roof that's talking, not you.\””@“Do not say anything at any time that you would not say at all times.”@“THE KID AND THE WOLF”

“A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country. For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite. After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes. When they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet. There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses, indeed, the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine. But just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door. In great fear the Mice scurried to a hiding place, where they lay quite still for a long time, hardly daring to breathe. When at last they ventured back to the feast, the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table, followed by the House Dog. The Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse's den only long enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella. \”You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not,\” she said as she hurried away, "but I prefer my plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it.\”” @\Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty.”@“THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE”

“A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them. The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain. Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust. \”What a fool I am,\” he said. \”Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for.\” And off he walked very, very scornfully.”@“There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.”@“THE FOX AND THE GRAPES”

“A certain Father had a family of Sons, who were forever quarreling among themselves. No words he could say did the least good, so he cast about in his mind for some very striking example that should make them see that discord would lead them to misfortune. One day when the quarreling had been much more violent than usual and each of the Sons was moping in a surly manner, he asked one of them to bring him a bundle of sticks. Then handing the bundle
to each of his Sons in turn he told them to try to break it. But although each one tried his best, none was able to do so. The Father then untied the bundle and gave the sticks to his Sons to break one by one. This they did very easily. \”My Sons,\” said the Father, \”do you not see how certain it is
that if you agree with each other and help each other, it will be impossible for your enemies to injure you? But if you are divided among yourselves, you will be no stronger than a single stick in that bundle.\”” @“In unity is strength.”@“THE BUNDLE OF STICKS”

“A Wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in his throat. He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy Wolf. So away he hurried to the Crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out. \”I will reward you very handsomely,\” said the Wolf, \”if you pull that bone out for me.\”
The Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a Wolf's throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do. When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away. \”But what about my reward!\” called the Crane anxiously. \”What!\” snarled the Wolf, whirling around. "Haven't you got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping it off?\””@“Expect no reward for serving the wicked.”@“THE WOLF AND THE CRANE”

“An Ass was being driven along a road leading down the mountain side, when he suddenly took it into his silly head to choose his own path. He could see his stall at the foot of the mountain, and to him the quickest way down seemed to be over the edge of the nearest cliff. Just as he was about to leap over, his master caught him by the tail and tried to pull him back, but the stubborn Ass would not yield and pulled with all his might. \”Very well,\” said his master, \”go your way, you willful beast, and see where it leads you." With that he let go, and the foolish Ass tumbled head over heels down the mountain side.”@“They who will not listen to reason but stubbornly go their own way against the friendly advice of those who are wiser than they, are on the road to misfortune.”@“THE ASS AND HIS DRIVER”

“A pair of Oxen were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a miry country road. They had to use all their strength to pull the wagon, but they did not complain. The Wheels of the wagon were of a different sort. Though the task they had to do was very light compared with that of the Oxen, they creaked and groaned at every turn. The poor Oxen, pulling with all their might to draw the wagon through the deep mud, had their ears filled with the loud complaining of the Wheels. And this, you may well know, made their work so much the harder to endure. \”Silence!\” the Oxen cried at last, out of patience. \”What have you Wheels to complain about so loudly? We are drawing all the weight, not you, and we are keeping still about it besides.\””@“They complain most who suffer least.”@“THE OXEN AND THE WHEELS”

“A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her. \”Spare me!\” begged the poor Mouse. \”Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you.\” The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go. Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free. \”You laughed when I said I would repay you,\” said the Mouse. \”Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion.\””@“A kindness is never wasted.”@“THE LION AND THE MOUSE”

A Shepherd Boy tended his master's Sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe. One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, \”Wolf! Wolf!\” As he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them. A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, \”Wolf! Wolf!\” Again the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again. Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep. In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting \”Wolf! Wolf!\” But though the Villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. \”He cannot fool us again,\” they said. The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then slipped away into the forest.@“Liars are not believed even when they speak the truth.”@“THE SHEPHERD BOY AND THE WOLF”

A Gnat flew over the meadow with much buzzing for so small a creature and settled on the tip of one of the horns of a Bull. After he had rested a short time, he made ready to fly away. But before he left he begged the Bull's pardon for having used his horn for a resting place. \”You must be very glad to have me go now,\” he said. \”It's all the same to me,\” replied the Bull. \”I did not even know you were there.\””@“We are often of greater importance in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbor. The smaller the mind the greater the conceit.”@“THE GNAT AND THE BULL”

“Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree. \”How useless is the Plane!\” said one of them. \”It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves.\” \”Ungrateful creatures!\” said a voice from the Plane Tree. \”You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!\””@“Our best blessings are often the least appreciated.”@“THE PLANE TREE”

“A Stork of a very simple and trusting nature had been asked by a gay party of Cranes to visit a field that had been newly planted. But the party ended dismally with all the birds entangled in the meshes of the Farmer's net. The Stork begged the Farmer to spare him. \”Please let me go,\” he pleaded. \”I belong to the Stork family who you know are honest and birds of good character. Besides, I did not know the Cranes were going to steal.\” \”You may be a very good bird,\” answered the Farmer, \”but I caught you with the thieving Cranes and you will have to share the same punishment with them.\””@“You are judged by the company you keep.”@“THE FARMER AND THE STORK”

“One day a shepherd discovered a fat Pig in the meadow where his Sheep were pastured. He very quickly captured the porker, which squealed at the top of its voice the moment the Shepherd laid his hands on it. You would have thought, to hear the loud squealing, that the Pig was being cruelly hurt. But in spite of its squeals and struggles to escape, the Shepherd tucked his prize under his arm and started off to the butcher's in the market place. The Sheep in the pasture were much astonished and amused at the Pig's behavior, and followed the Shepherd and his charge to the pasture gate. \”What makes you squeal like that?\” asked one of the Sheep. \”The Shepherd often catches and carries off one of us. But we should feel very much ashamed to make such a terrible fuss about it like you do.\” \”That is all very well,\” replied the Pig, with a squeal and a frantic kick. \”When he catches you he is only after your wool. But he wants my bacon! gree-ee-ee!\””@“It is easy to be brave when there is no danger.”@“THE SHEEP AND THE PIG”

“Two men were traveling in company along the road when one of them picked up a well-filled purse. \”How lucky I am!\” he said. \”I have found a purse. Judging by its weight it must be full of gold.\” \”Do not say 'I have found a purse,’\” said his companion. \”Say rather 'we have found a purse' and 'how lucky we are.' Travelers ought to share alike the fortunes or misfortunes of the road.\” \”No, no,\” replied the other angrily. \”I found it and I am going to keep it.\” Just then they heard a shout of "Stop, thief!" and looking around, saw a mob of people armed with clubs coming down the road. The man who had found the purse fell into a panic. \”We are lost if they find the purse on us,\” he cried. \”No, no,\” replied the other, \”You would not say 'we' before, so now stick to your 'I'. Say 'I am lost.’\””@“We cannot expect any one to share our misfortunes unless we are willing to share our good fortune also.”@“THE TRAVELERS AND THE PURSE”

“One day as the Lion walked proudly down a forest aisle, and the animals respectfully made way for him, an Ass brayed a scornful remark as he passed. The Lion felt a flash of anger. But when he turned his head and saw who had spoken, he walked quietly on. He would not honor the fool with even so much as a stroke of his claws.”@“Do not resent the remarks of a fool. Ignore them.”@“THE LION AND THE ASS”

“The Frogs were tired of governing themselves. They had so much freedom that it had spoiled them, and they did nothing but sit around croaking in a bored manner and wishing for a government that could entertain them with the pomp and display of royalty, and rule them in a way to make them know they were being ruled. No milk and water government for them, they declared. So they sent a petition to Jupiter asking for a king. Jupiter saw what simple and foolish creatures they were, but to keep them quiet and make them think they had a king he threw down a huge log, which fell into the water with a great splash. The Frogs hid themselves among the reeds and grasses, thinking the new king to be some fearful giant. But they soon discovered how tame and peaceable King Log was. In a short time the younger Frogs were using him for a diving platform, while the older Frogs made him a meeting place, where they complained loudly to Jupiter about the government. To teach the Frogs a lesson the ruler of the gods now sent a Crane to be king of Frogland. The Crane proved to be a very different sort of king from old King Log. He gobbled up the poor Frogs right and left and they soon saw what fools they had been. In mournful croaks they begged Jupiter to take away the cruel tyrant before they should all be destroyed. \”How now!\” cried Jupiter \”Are you not yet content? You have what you asked for and so you have only yourselves to blame for your misfortunes.\””@“Be sure you can better your condition before you seek to change.”@“THE FROGS WHO WISHED FOR A KING”

“The Owl always takes her sleep during the day. Then after sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now her weird "hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo" echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat. Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window. \”Get away from here, sir,\” she said to the Grasshopper. \”Have you no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!\” But the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak. Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune. The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him. \”Well sir,\” she said, \”if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me. I know it will make you sing like Apollo himself.\” The foolish Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering words. Up he jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as he was near enough so the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him up.”@“Flattery is not a proof of true admiration. Do not let flattery throw you off your guard against an enemy.”@“THE OWL AND THE GRASSHOPPER”

“A Wolf left his lair one evening in fine spirits and an excellent appetite. As he ran, the setting sun cast his shadow far out on the ground, and it looked as if the wolf were a hundred times bigger than he really was. \”Why,\” exclaimed the Wolf proudly, \”see how big I am! Fancy me running away from a puny Lion! I'll show him who is fit to be king, he or I.\” Just then an immense shadow blotted him out entirely, and the next instant a Lion struck him down with a single blow.”@“Do not let your fancy make you forget realities.”@“THE WOLF AND HIS SHADOW”

“A Giant Oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender Reeds. When the wind blew, the great Oak stood proudly upright with its hundred arms uplifted to the sky. But the Reeds bowed low in the wind and sang a sad and mournful song. \”You have reason to complain,\” said the Oak. \”The slightest breeze that ruffles the surface of the water makes you bow your heads, while I, the mighty Oak, stand upright and firm before the howling tempest.\” \”Do not worry about us,\” replied the Reeds. \”The winds do not harm us. We bow before them and so we do not break. You, in all your pride and strength, have so far resisted their blows. But the end is coming.\” As the Reeds spoke a great hurricane rushed out of the north. The Oak stood proudly and fought against the storm, while the yielding Reeds bowed low. The wind redoubled in fury, and all at once the great tree fell, torn up by the roots, and lay among the
pitying Reeds.”@“Better to yield when it is folly to resist, than to resist stubbornly and be destroyed.”@“THE OAK AND THE REEDS”

“A Rat was traveling along the King's highway. He was a very proud Rat, considering his small size and the bad reputation all Rats have. As Mr. Rat walked along--he kept mostly to the ditch--he noticed a great commotion up the road, and soon a grand procession came in view. It was the King and his retinue. The King rode on a huge Elephant adorned with the most gorgeous trappings. With the King in his luxurious howdah were the royal Dog and Cat. A great crowd of people followed the procession. They were so taken up with admiration of the Elephant, that the Rat was not noticed. His pride was hurt. \”What fools!\” he cried. \”Look at me, and you will soon forget that clumsy Elephant! Is it his great size that makes your eyes pop out? Or is it his wrinkled hide? Why, I have eyes and ears and as many legs as he! I am of just as much importance, and\”—But just then the royal Cat spied him, and the next instant, the Rat knew he was not quite so important as an Elephant.”@“A resemblance to the great in some things does not make us great.”@“THE RAT AND THE ELEPHANT”

“Some Boys were playing one day at the edge of a pond in which lived a family of Frogs. The Boys amused themselves by throwing stones into the pond so as to make them skip on top of the water. The stones were flying thick and fast and the Boys were enjoying themselves very much; but the poor Frogs in the pond were trembling with fear. At last one of the Frogs, the oldest and bravest, put his head out of the water, and said, "Oh, please, dear children, stop your cruel play! Though it may be fun for you, it means death to us!"@“Always stop to think whether your fun may not be the cause of another's unhappiness.”@“THE BOYS AND THE FROGS”

“In a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it. But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how he tried, the Crow could not reach the water. The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst. Then an idea came to him. Picking up some small pebbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. With each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink.”@“In a pinch a good use of our wits may help us out.”@“THE CROW AND THE PITCHER”

“One bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine, drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving Grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat. \”What!\” cried the Ants in surprise, \”haven't you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all last summer?\” \”I didn't have time to store up any food,\” whined the Grasshopper; \”I was so busy making music that before I knew it the summer was gone.\” The Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust. \”Making music, were you?\” they cried. \”Very well; now dance!\” And they turned their backs on the Grasshopper and went on with their work.”@“There's a time for work and a time for play.”@“THE ANTS AND THE GRASSHOPPER”

“A sacred Image was being carried to the temple. It was mounted on an Ass adorned with garlands and gorgeous trappings, and a grand procession of priests and pages followed it through the streets. As the Ass walked along, the people bowed their heads reverently or fell on their knees, and the Ass thought the honor was being paid to himself. With his head full of this foolish idea, he became so puffed up with pride and vanity that he halted and started to bray loudly. But in the midst of his song, his driver guessed what the Ass had got into his head, and began to beat him unmercifully with a stick. \”Go along with you, you stupid Ass,\” he cried. \”The honor is not meant for you but for the image you are carrying.\””@“Do not try to take the credit to yourself that is due to others.”@“THE ASS CARRYING THE IMAGE”

“A Raven, which you know is black as coal, was envious of the Swan, because her feathers were as white as the purest snow. The foolish bird got the idea that if he lived like the Swan, swimming and diving all day long and eating the weeds and plants that grow in the water, his feathers would turn white like the Swan's. So he left his home in the woods and fields and flew down to live on the lakes and in the marshes. But though he washed and washed all day long, almost drowning himself at it, his feathers remained as black as ever. And as the water weeds he ate did not agree with him, he got thinner and thinner, and at last he died.”@“A change of habits will not alter nature.”@“A RAVEN AND A SWAN”

“Two Goats, frisking gayly on the rocky steeps of a mountain valley, chanced to meet, one on each side of a deep chasm through which poured a mighty mountain torrent. The trunk of a fallen tree formed the only means of crossing the chasm, and on this not even two squirrels could have passed each other in safety. The narrow path would have made the bravest tremble. Not so our Goats. Their pride would not permit either to stand aside for the other. One set her foot on the log. The other did likewise. In the middle they met horn to horn. Neither would give way, and so they both fell, to be swept away by the roaring torrent below.”@“It is better to yield than to come to misfortune through stubbornness.”@“THE TWO GOATS”

“A Merchant, driving his Ass homeward from the seashore with a heavy load of salt, came to a river crossed by a shallow ford. They had crossed this river many times before without accident, but this time the Ass slipped and fell when halfway over. And when the Merchant at last got him to his feet, much of the salt had melted away. Delighted to find how much lighter his burden had become, the Ass finished the journey very gayly. Next day the Merchant went for another load of salt. On the way home the Ass, remembering what had happened at the ford, purposely let himself fall into the water, and again got rid of most of his burden. The angry Merchant immediately turned about and drove the Ass back to the seashore, where he loaded him with two great baskets of sponges. At the ford the Ass again tumbled over; but when he had scrambled to his feet, it was a very disconsolate Ass that dragged himself homeward under a load ten times heavier than before.”@“The same measures will not suit all circumstances.”@“THE ASS AND THE LOAD OF SALT”

“\”Away with you, vile insect!" said a Lion angrily to a Gnat that was buzzing around his head. But the Gnat was not in the least disturbed. \”Do you think,\” he said spitefully to the Lion, \”that I am afraid of you because they call you king?\” The next instant he flew at the Lion and stung him sharply on the nose. Mad with rage, the Lion struck fiercely at the Gnat, but only succeeded in tearing himself with his claws. Again and again the Gnat stung the Lion, who now was roaring terribly. At last, worn out with rage and covered with wounds that his own teeth and claws had made, the Lion gave up the fight. The Gnat buzzed away to tell the whole world about his victory, but instead he flew straight into a spider's web. And there, he who had defeated the King of beasts came to a miserable end, the prey of a little spider.”@The least of our enemies is often the most to be feared.

“A certain man who visited foreign lands could talk of little when he returned to his home except the wonderful adventures he had met with and the great deeds he had done abroad. One of the feats he told about was a leap he had made in a city Called Rhodes. That leap was so great, he said, that no other man could leap anywhere near the distance. A great many persons in Rhodes had seen him do it and would prove that what he told was true. \”No need of witnesses,\” said one of the hearers. \”Suppose this city is Rhodes.

“At a great celebration in honor of King Lion, the Monkey was asked to dance for the company. His dancing was very clever indeed, and the animals were all highly pleased with his grace and lightness. The praise that was showered on the Monkey made the Camel envious. He was very sure that he could dance quite as well as the Monkey, if not better, so he pushed his way into the crowd that was gathered around the Monkey, and rising on his hind legs, began to dance. But the big hulking Camel made himself very ridiculous as he kicked out his knotty legs and twisted his long clumsy neck. Besides, the animals found it hard to keep their toes from under his heavy hoofs. At last, when one of his huge feet came within an inch of King Lion's nose, the animals were so disgusted that they set upon the Camel in a rage and drove him out into the desert. Shortly afterward, refreshments, consisting mostly of Camel's
hump and ribs, were served to the company.”@“Do not try to ape your betters.”@“THE MONKEY AND THE CAMEL”

“A Wild Boar was sharpening his tusks busily against the stump of a tree, when a Fox happened by. Now the Fox was always looking for a chance to make fun of his neighbors. So he made a great show of looking anxiously about, as if in fear of some hidden enemy. But the Boar kept right on with his work. \”Why are you doing that?\” asked the Fox at last with a grin. \”There isn't any danger that I can see.\” \”True enough,\” replied the Boar, \”but when danger does come there will not be time for such work as this.

“An Ass and a Fox had become close comrades, and were constantly in each other's company. While the Ass cropped a fresh bit of greens, the Fox would devour a chicken from the neighboring farmyard or a bit of cheese filched from the dairy. One day the pair unexpectedly met a Lion. The Ass was very much frightened, but the Fox calmed his fears. \”I will talk to him,\” he said. So the Fox walked boldly up to the Lion. \”Your highness,\” he said in an undertone, so the Ass could not hear him, \”I’ve got a fine scheme in my head. If you promise not to hurt me, I will lead that foolish creature yonder into a pit where he can't get out, and you can feast at your pleasure.\” The Lion agreed and the Fox returned to the Ass. \”I made him promise not to hurt us,\” said the Fox. \”But come, I know a good place to hide till he is gone.\” So the Fox led the Ass into a deep pit. But when the Lion saw that the Ass was his for the taking, he first of all struck down the traitor Fox.”@“Traitors may expect treachery.”@“THE ASS, THE FOX, AND THE LION”

“The Birds and the Beasts declared war against each other. No compromise was possible, and so they went at it tooth and claw. It is said the quarrel grew out of the persecution the race of Geese suffered at the teeth of the Fox family. The Beasts, too, had cause for fight. The Eagle was constantly pouncing on the Hare, and the Owl dined daily on Mice. It was a terrible battle. Many a Hare and many a Mouse died. Chickens and Geese fell by the score--and the victor always stopped for a feast. Now the Bat family had not openly joined either side. They were a very politic race. So when they saw the Birds getting the better of it, they were Birds for all there was in it. But when the tide of battle turned, they immediately sided with the Beasts. When the battle was over, the conduct of the Bats was discussed at the peace conference. Such deceit was unpardonable, and Birds and Beasts made common cause to drive out the Bats. And since then the Bat family hides in dark towers and deserted ruins, flying out only in the night.”@“The deceitful have no friends.”@“THE BIRDS, THE BEASTS, AND THE BAT”

“Just as a great Bear rushed to seize a stray kid, a Lion leaped from another direction upon the same prey. The two fought furiously for the prize until they had received so many wounds that both sank down unable to continue the battle. Just then a Fox dashed up, and seizing the kid, made off with it
as fast as he could go, while the Lion and the Bear looked on in helpless rage. \”How much better it would have been,\” they said, \”to have shared
in a friendly spirit.\””@“Those who have all the toil do not always get the profit.”@“THE LION, THE BEAR, AND THE FOX”

“A stray Lamb stood drinking early one morning on the bank of a woodland stream. That very same morning a hungry Wolf came by farther up the stream, hunting for something to eat. He soon got his eyes on the Lamb. As a rule Mr. Wolf snapped up such delicious morsels without making any bones about it, but this Lamb looked so very helpless and innocent that the Wolf felt he ought to have some kind of an excuse for taking its life. \”How dare you paddle around in my stream and stir up all the mud!\” he shouted fiercely. \”You deserve to be punished severely for your rashness!\” \”But, your highness,\” replied the trembling Lamb, \”do not be angry! I cannot possibly muddy the water you are drinking up there. Remember, you are upstream and I am downstream.\” \”You _do_ muddy it!\” retorted the Wolf savagely. "And besides, I have heard that you told lies about me last year!" \”How could I have done so?\” pleaded the Lamb. \”I wasn't born until this year.\” \”If it wasn't you, it was your brother!\” \”I have no brothers.\” \”Well, then,\” snarled the Wolf, \”It was someone in your family anyway. But no matter who it was, I do not intend to be talked out of my breakfast.\” And without more words the Wolf seized the poor Lamb and carried her off to the forest.”@“The tyrant can always find an excuse for his tyranny.

“A Wolf had been hurt in a fight with a Bear. He was unable to move and could not satisfy his hunger and thirst. A Sheep passed by near his hiding place, and the Wolf called to him. \”Please fetch me a drink of water,\” he begged, \”that might give me strength enough so I can get me some solid food.\” \”Solid food!\” said the Sheep. \”That means me, I suppose.

On the way they passed a pond where a family of Frogs was sitting among the reeds on the bank.

“The Fox one day thought of a plan to amuse himself at the expense of the Stork, at whose odd appearance he was always laughing. \”You must come and dine with me today,\” he said to the Stork, smiling to himself at the trick he was going to play. The Stork gladly accepted the invitation and arrived in good time and with a very good appetite. For dinner the Fox served soup. But it was set out in a very shallow dish, and all the Stork could do was to wet the very tip of his bill. Not a drop of soup could he get. But the Fox lapped it up easily, and, to increase the disappointment of the Stork, made a great show of enjoyment.\” The hungry Stork was much displeased at the trick, but he was a calm, even-tempered fellow and saw no good in flying into a rage. Instead, not long afterward, he invited the Fox to dine with him in turn. The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set, and the Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing smell. But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck. The Stork could easily get at the food with his long bill, but all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar, and sniff at the delicious odor. And when the Fox lost his temper, the Stork said calmly:”@“Do not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself.”@“THE FOX AND THE STORK”

That is some fisherman's skiff, with the day's catch of savoury fish." Still nearer came the object. The waves washed it up on shore. \”It is a chest of gold lost from some wreck,\” they cried.

“A Wolf had stolen a Lamb and was carrying it off to his lair to eat it. But his plans were very much changed when he met a Lion, who, without making any excuses, took the Lamb away from him. The Wolf made off to a safe distance, and then said in a much injured tone: \”You have no right to take my property like that!\” The Lion looked back, but as the Wolf was too far away to be taught a lesson without too much inconvenience, he said: \”Your property?

“A Stag, drinking from a crystal spring, saw himself mirrored in the clear water. He greatly admired the graceful arch of his antlers, but he was very much ashamed of his spindling legs. \”How can it be,\” he sighed, \”that I should be cursed with such legs when I have so magnificent a crown.\” At that moment he scented a panther and in an instant was bounding away through the forest. But as he ran his wide-spreading antlers caught in the branches of the trees, and soon the Panther overtook him.

“The Peacock, they say, did not at first have the beautiful feathers in which he now takes so much pride. These, Juno, whose favorite he was, granted to him one day when he begged her for a train of feathers to distinguish him from the other birds. Then, decked in his finery, gleaming with emerald, gold, purple, and azure, he strutted proudly among the birds. All regarded him with envy. Even the most beautiful pheasant could see that his beauty was surpassed. Presently the Peacock saw an Eagle soaring high up in the blue sky and felt a desire to fly, as he had been accustomed to do. Lifting his wings he tried to rise from the ground. But the weight of his magnificent train held him down. Instead of flying up to greet the first rays of the morning sun or to bathe in the rosy light among the floating clouds at sunset, he would have to walk the ground more encumbered and oppressed than any common barnyard fowl.”@“Do not sacrifice your freedom for the sake of pomp and show.”@“THE PEACOCK”

“The Weasels and the Mice were always up in arms against each other. In every battle the Weasels carried off the victory, as well as a large number of the Mice, which they ate for dinner next day. In despair the Mice called a council, and there it was decided that the Mouse army was always beaten because it had no leaders. So a large number of generals and commanders were appointed from among the most eminent Mice. To distinguish themselves from the soldiers in the ranks, the new leaders proudly bound on their heads lofty crests and ornaments of feathers or straw. Then after long preparation of the Mouse army in all the arts of war, they sent a challenge to the Weasels. The Weasels accepted the challenge with eagerness, for they were always ready for a fight when a meal was in sight. They immediately attacked the Mouse army in large numbers. Soon the Mouse line gave way before the attack and the whole army fled for cover. The privates easily slipped into their holes, but the Mouse leaders could not squeeze through the narrow openings because of their head-dresses. Not one escaped the teeth of the hungry Weasels.”@“Greatness has its penalties.”@“THE MICE AND THE WEASELS”

“A Wolf prowling near a village one evening met a Dog. It happened to be a very lean and bony Dog, and Master Wolf would have turned up his nose at such meager fare had he not been more hungry than usual. So he began to edge toward the Dog, while the Dog backed away. \”Let me remind your lordship,\” said the Dog, his words interrupted now and then as he dodged a snap of the Wolf's teeth, \”how unpleasant it would be to eat me now. Look at my ribs. I am
nothing but skin and bone. But let me tell you something in private. In a few days my master will give a wedding feast for his only daughter. You can guess how fine and fat I will grow on the scraps from the table. _Then_ is the time to eat me.\” The Wolf could not help thinking how nice it would be to have a fine fat Dog to eat instead of the scrawny object before him. So he went away pulling in his belt and promising to return. Some days later the Wolf came back for the promised feast. He found the Dog in his master's yard, and asked him to come out and be eaten. \”Sir,\” said the Dog, with a grin, \”I shall be delighted to have you eat me. I'll be out as soon as the porter opens the door.\” But the \”porter\” was a huge Dog whom the Wolf knew by painful experience to be very unkind toward wolves.

The Ass was to go into the cave and drive the Goats out, while the Lion would stand at the entrance to strike them down. The plan worked beautifully. The Ass made such a frightful din in the cave, kicking and braying with all his might, that the Goats came running out in a panic of fear, only to fall victim to the Lion.

Then one day all the Dogs in the neighborhood got together and met him on his way with the basket. The Dog tried to run away from them. But at last he stopped to argue. That was his mistake.

“A Jackdaw chanced to fly over the garden of the King's palace. There he saw with much wonder and envy a flock of royal Peacocks in all the glory of their splendid plumage. Now the black Jackdaw was not a very handsome bird, nor very refined in manner. Yet he imagined that all he needed to make himself fit for the society of the Peacocks was a dress like theirs. So he picked up some castoff feathers of the Peacocks and stuck them among his own black plumes. Dressed in his borrowed finery he strutted loftily among the birds of his own kind. Then he flew down into the garden among the Peacocks. But they soon saw who he was. Angry at the cheat, they flew at him, plucking away the borrowed feathers and also some of his own.

Had it not been for the Dolphins, who at that time were very friendly toward mankind and especially toward Athenians, all would have perished. But the Dolphins took the shipwrecked people on their backs and swam with them to shore. Now it was the custom among the Greeks to take their pet monkeys and dogs with them whenever they went on a voyage. So when one of the Dolphins saw a Monkey struggling in the water, he thought it was a man, and made the Monkey climb up on his back. Then off he swam with him toward the shore. The Monkey sat up, grave and dignified, on the Dolphin's back. \”You are a citizen of illustrious Athens, are you not?\” asked the Dolphin politely. \”Yes,\” answered the Monkey, proudly. \”My family is one of the noblest in the city.\” \”Indeed,\” said the Dolphin. \”Then of course you often visit Piraeus.\” \”Yes, yes,\” replied the Monkey. \”Indeed, I do. I am with him constantly. Piraeus is my very best friend.\” This answer took the Dolphin by surprise, and, turning his head, he now saw what it was he was carrying.

“An Ass was feeding in a pasture near a wood when he saw a Wolf lurking in the shadows along the hedge. He easily guessed what the Wolf had in mind, and thought of a plan to save himself. So he pretended he was lame, and began to hobble painfully. When the Wolf came up, he asked the Ass what had made him lame, and the Ass replied that he had stepped on a sharp thorn. \”Please pull it out,\” he pleaded, groaning as if in pain. \”If you
do not, it might stick in your throat when you eat me.\” The Wolf saw the wisdom of the advice, for he wanted to enjoy his meal without any danger of choking. So the Ass lifted up his foot and the Wolf began to search very closely and carefully for the thorn. Just then the Ass kicked out with all his might, tumbling the Wolf a dozen paces away.

“Once upon a time a Cat and a Monkey lived as pets in the same house. They were great friends and were constantly in all sorts of mischief together. What they seemed to think of more than anything else was to get something to eat, and it did not matter much to them how they got it. One day they were sitting by the fire, watching some chestnuts roasting on the hearth. How to get them was the question. \”I would gladly get them,\” said the cunning Monkey, \”but you are much more skillful at such things than I am. Pull them out and I'll divide them between us.\” Pussy stretched out her paw very carefully, pushed aside some of the cinders, and drew back her paw very quickly. Then she tried it again, this time pulling a chestnut half out of the fire. A third time and she drew out the chestnut. This performance she went through several times, each time singeing her paw severely. As fast as she pulled the chestnuts out of the fire, the Monkey ate them up. Now the master came in, and away scampered the rascals, Mistress Cat with a burnt paw and no chestnuts.

Still he kept up a flow of sarcastic talk, just to exercise his wits and to have the fun of disputing.

Here you can get all you want of the finest, tenderest grass in the country.\” The Goat looked over the edge of the cliff. \”How very, very anxious you are about me,\” she said, \”and how generous you are with your grass! But I know you! It's your own appetite you are thinking of, not mine!\””@“An invitation prompted by selfishness is not to be accepted.”@“THE WOLF AND THE GOAT”

“One day as an Ass was walking in the pasture, he found some Grasshoppers chirping merrily in a grassy corner of the field. He listened with a great deal of admiration to the song of the Grasshoppers. It was such a joyful song that his pleasure-loving heart was filled with a wish to sing as they did. \”What is it?\” he asked very respectfully, \”that has given you such beautiful voices? Is there any special food you eat, or is it some divine nectar that makes you sing so wonderfully?\” \”Yes,\” said the Grasshoppers, who were very fond of a joke; \”it is the dew we drink! Try some and see.\” So thereafter the Ass would eat nothing and drink nothing but dew. Naturally, the poor foolish Ass soon died.”@“The laws of nature are unchangeable.”@“THE ASS AND THE GRASSHOPPERS”
